                    The <b>World Wide Web</b>, also known as <b>WWW</b>, is made up of a collection
                    of html documents. The WWW consists of 4 main components: <b>Internet, Browser, HTTP, and
                    Servers</b>. There is a process in which the WWW works using these components. First, a computer
                    has a web browser like Chrome or Safari running. Requests are sent from the
                    computer through HTTP, the main protocol of the web, to the internet, the world's
                    largest computer network. The internet sends this request, once again, through HTTP
                    to Servers, the computers that are hosting the files on the web. A response to the
                    request is sent back to the computer that sent the initial request through the same
                    process, but in reverse.

                    HTML, an acronym for HyperText Markup Language, is the langauge used in the 
                    documents we see on the internet to tell the computer what to do on 
                    those documents. The language has a set of terms that represent certain 
                    code within a given HTML document. An element refers to an opening 
                    tag, closing tag, and the content between the two, as a whole. There are 
                    elements that allow attributes to them, which allow images, videos, and 
                    hyperlinks to be added onto the document. An example is the "href" 
                    attribute that can be placed in an "a" tag, known as an anchor tag, 
                    with text in between the opening and closing "a" tags as the content of 
                    the element to represent the value of the "href"attribute, the hyperlink.
                    An example is <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>, a link created by 
                    the following code:<br>
                    <em>
                        <span id="Examplefont">
                            &lt;a href="https://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;
                        </span>

                    Inline and Block are the two elements that HTML elements can 
                    possibly be. The difference between the two elements is the
                    Block element often places an "invisible box" around its 
                    content, which creates a separation from all other content within
                    other elements, surrounding a barrier-like object around 
                    the content within the said block element.

              CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and is essential for preventing
              repetition in html code in order to make it look cleaner. Sections
              of text, images, video, or any other conent can be given a "class" or
              "id" value that can be linked to a CSS document, so any attributes
              can easily and quickly be added to the specified class/id. There
              are thousands of attributes that can be added to content. CSS
              documents can be a central reference of attributes for values that
              are apart of any other html document that is linked to the said CSS
              document. It is fascinating!
